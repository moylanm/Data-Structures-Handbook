# Data Structures Handbook

by Myles Moylan

A data structure is an implementation of an abstract data type (ADT) which allows programmers to manage the complexity of a problem domain by hiding the details of the data.

Below is a list of some of the data structures that I am familiar with:

* [Array](array.md)
* [Tuple](tuple.md)
* [Dictionary](dictionary.md)
* [Set](set.md)
* [Linked List](linked_list.md)
* [Stack](stack.md)
* [Queue](queue.md)
* [Tree](tree.md)
* [Graph](graph.md)
